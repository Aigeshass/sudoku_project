# sudoku_project
Mainly I created sudoku game with backtracking method. The program solves sudoku first and then matches user's input with own solution. If the number placed in the correct place, on the left corner at the bottom string "Correct" appears, otherwise "Wrong". Additionally, timer is included to determine how much you needed to finish sudoku. 
You can change initialized sudoku or append randomizer to get differnet combination of numbers with every compilation.
